            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

But how (you will say) may this <hi>Tract of Conscience</hi> Cure this so great a maladie? Yes, very fitly: this trouble (as I conceiue) arising not from want of <hi>eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> but <hi>skill</hi> in the <hi>Schoole</hi> of <hi>Christ.

Vnto your selfe therefore I first cōmend these first fruits of my <hi>Labours</hi> in this kind, for your edification in our <hi>most holy faith,</hi> &amp; encrease of our <hi>Ioy</hi> here, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>happinesse</hi> with Christ hereafter.

<note place="margin">Gal. 1.16.</note> matters not the reasoning of natural and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pollicy, nor yet the discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements attending the Lords Worthies, but with courage and vndaunted resolution enters and vndergoes the office of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, whose endeuours were the rather opposed by Satan, for that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27800:18"/>of a friend, he became the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test enemy to his kingdome, in zeale and industry doubling the rest of his follow Ambassadours.</p>
               <p>In the 20. Chapter he goes bound in the spirit to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> in 21. is assaulted by the <hi>Iewes;</hi> in the 22. and 23. is pleading his innocency before the Captaine <hi>Lysias,</hi> by whom he was cōuayd from thence, fearing the <hi>Iewes</hi> intended outrage: here he stands before <hi>Faelix</hi> Iudgement seate, to answere the bitter allegations of <hi>Tertullus,</hi> suborned thereto by the chiefe of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the 5. verse, and hauing libertie to answere for himselfe in the 10. he after his Preface re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes their calumnies; 1. by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the 11. and 12. verses: 2. by Concession in 14.15.16. verses; 3. by a true Relation of his carriage lately at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in 17. and so to the 20. verse. For his Concession, whereof our subiect is a part, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:27800:19"/>in the 5. verse, <hi>Tertullus</hi> had couched some truthes (though besmeared with base tearmes) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his false and bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiues, to wit, that <hi>Paul</hi> was a Ring-leader of the heresie of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> which had it beene vttered in modest tearmes, was a truth; for <hi>Paul</hi> was a Standard-bearer of that faith, which they defamed with the title of heresie. Now <hi>Pauls</hi> conscience is so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he will not so defend his owne innocency, as for feare of danger, depart from a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confession of the truth, and therefore grants; 1. that he did worship God after that way w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> they stiled heresie in 14.2. the particular heads of this worship; as, 1. faith in all diuine truthes, in 14.2. hope of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in 15.3. Externall obedience in 16.</p>
               <p>These words then are an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of Conscience, or an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of <hi>Paules</hi> life; wherein are

God, 2. men.</p>
               <p>The sense of the Verse may be comprised into this Paraphrase, Yea I rest not in the profession of the true faith, but doe studie and striue herein to haue an excusing and quiet conscience, both in things respecting Gods immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate worship, and justice to men: our Apostle, we see, contents not himselfe with the graces of faith and hope, but proceeds to the practice of externall obedience: Whence arises this obseruation,</p>

We reade that <hi>Moses</hi> sent on his foster fathers quarrel, against the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> (whose daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after he married, and was therefore checked of his brother and sister) that he might make a speedie onset, tooke his iourney through the wildernesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were flying Serpents, very deadly; which to expell, he trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned certaine birds, in whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>Thus farre we haue handled the seuerall offices of <hi>Conscience;</hi> it remaines, that we consider the manner, how it performes them, <hi>viz.</hi> by a conclusion drawne from a Logicall Discourse, or Syllogisme; <hi>Conscience</hi> it selfe affording both the premisses, wherein the Conclusion is ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually comprised. There is in Conscience a speculatiue part, called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, comprising the principles of right reason, the lawes of good and euill; which in this Discourse affords the first proposition, being indeed one of its principles. There is also a practicall part, called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:27800:84"/>(which by some is strictly taken for <hi>Conscience</hi> it selfe,) the which supplies the Assumption, partly from its own acquaintance with our hearts, and liues, and partly from the euidence of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in vs; from both which issues the Conclusion, composing a compleate Syllogisme.</p>
               <p>Now this Discourse is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed either about our selues or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. First, for our selues, It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines, 1. the state of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or 2. the facts of the person: of the state, whether of 1. grace, 2. corruption. First, of the state of grace, it discouers thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ,</hi> sayth the speculatiue part, but I am in Christ, faith the practicall, <hi>ergo,</hi> there is no condemnation to me. Now if the spirit of bondage should lust to cauill at the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, <hi>Conscience</hi> is readie to proue it thus: Such are in Christ as walke not after the flesh, but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27800:85"/>after the spirit, but so doe I, therefore I am in Christ.</p>
               <p>In like manner, <hi>Conscience</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the state of the wicked, thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. Such as obey not the truth, are heires of wrath, but I obey not the truth, <hi>ergo:</hi> or thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. Such as withhold the truth in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, are in the way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; but such an one am I, <hi>ergo.</hi>

Doth not the <hi>Psalmist</hi> conclude, there is no feare of God in the wicked; partly, from the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their owne hearts. <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.1. and partly from a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, drawne from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked liues, in the 2. and 3. verses. The like may be obserued in <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning his own cause, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.8. His aduersaries had intimate his reprobate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which he to refute chuses
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27800:86"/>an Argument drawne from the innocency of his life, thus: Such as doe nothing against the truth, but all things for the truth, are not reprobates, but I doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against the truth, but all things for the truth: therefore.</p>
               <p>Euen so also as <hi>Conscience</hi> jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>person,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so of the <hi>factes and workes,</hi> whether good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning factes to be done; when a motion is brought into the phantasie, either by the senses, or inward suggestion, <hi>Conscience</hi> cals it to the censure, &amp; by the principles it hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the Word, determines of it; if euill, to the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition. Youthfull lusts are to be auoided by the vessels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but such is this, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. But if the motion be of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable nature, it brings it to the word of dispensatiō, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. this is of good report, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and vertuous, therefore to be embraced.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:27800:86"/>
               <p n="2">2. Of things alreadie done, <hi>Conscience</hi> determines whether well or ill done. It lookes into the Court-Roles, and finding vpon Record, some former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, though long since com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it cals it to the barre, as we see in <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. After twentie yeares si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, thus: Such as are merciles, shall haue judgement without mercy; but such were we to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our brother. And this it doth not only in capitall crimes, but in the least offence, if it be liuely, as in <hi>Dauid,</hi> no violence is to be done to Kings, <hi>touch not mine annoynted,</hi> but the <hi>cutting off of his lap,</hi> is a violence. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5.</p>
               <p>But in case vpon inquisition made, it finde a good worke, a zealous endeuour, it treasures it vp for necessary vses, and from its approbation, emboldens vs both to expect and pray for a comfortable reward. <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.14.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:27800:87"/>The good endeuours of any for the promotion of the Lords cause, shall neuer be forgotten, but such, and such haue beene my endeuours herein.</p>
               <p>Thus farre of <hi>Conscience</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about our selues. It hath to doe also about others, though differently; <hi>Dauids</hi> heart told him, what was the voyce of a wicked mans <hi>Conscience</hi> within him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.1. And our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaking of the good workes of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> concludes thence their Election of God, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.4. Concerning which censure, for that to some it may seeme a tickle nicitie, obserue 1. the grounds it hath: 2. the cases wherein it deales: 3. the limits it exceeds not.</p>
               <p>It is well assured,
<note place="margin">Grounds.</note> that nature hath framed all men of the like mould, all of the like temper, the like cogitations, appetites, and passions, that are in some, it sees in others also: so that finding its
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:27800:87"/>owne heart envious, ambitious, worldly, lustfull, it concludes from this principle, the heart of euery man meerely naturall, to be of the same qualitie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its one of <hi>Conscience</hi> Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that Originall sinne admits not more or lesse, equally defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all flesh: there is no degrees of death in death, he that was flaine by one, is as truely dead, as he that was mangled with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wounds: so that what stirrings of corruption it finds in its own, it is well assured might be found in others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods Image is the same in all; I see, sayth <hi>Conscience</hi> a thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in grace, and vtter detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all sinne, a daily decay of the life, and dominion of sinne in my heart; &amp; so I am sure, it is more or lesse, in all the Lords plants. From these groundes is <hi>Conscience</hi> emboldened to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle for the Cases.</p>

               <p n="2">2. In case of Christian admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, where fit disswasiues can neuer be vsed, vntill we haue in our hearts censured the cause to be euill.</p>

In case of imitation, or eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of such examples as are proposed to our senses; who can resolue of <hi>Dauids</hi> patience for i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, or <hi>Shimeies</hi> railing for detestation, vnlesse before he haue in his owne soule determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the equitie of the one, and iniquitie of the other cause.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The carriage of it must be priuate, if it should proceede to any publicke desamation of any person, it would transgresse those Rules of sobrietie, prescribed for the maintenance of our brothers credit: personall, and nominall application is therefore vnfit, for that euery man hath a discursiue faculty within him, applying ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall truthes to euery ones par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vses.</p>

<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> We are here exhorted to suppresse the first motions of sinne in vs, since our <hi>Consciences</hi> doe censure not onely facts, but the first inclinations thereto, whose checks could we obserue and second with an endeuour of reformation, our soules might be preserued from splitting on the rockes of temptation: few there are that vnderstand the benefit of a Christian watch, but such as through experience haue tasted the sweetnesse of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, will witnesse with me what a cooler it is to inordinate lusts. <hi>Dauid</hi> found the fruites of it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.11.

               <p n="3">3. This lastly,
<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> exhorts vs to a Christian care in the following, or shunning of others examples, wherein sheepish imitation of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a blemish; we haue the Law cases of heauen in our breastes, to rule our owne, and censure others liues.

               <p>The fift and last thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be handled, is the bond of <hi>Conscience,</hi> which sets it aworke, and tyes it, so that it cannot doe otherwise then it doth.

               <p n="1">1. Absolute bond is twofold, 1. God, who is the onely Lord
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:27800:92"/>in the hearts of men: <hi>Caesar</hi> may exact tribute of men; and Kings rule their subiects after their owne pleasure, yet in all their commandes, they are to meddle with the outward man, wherein if a man be conformable, the law inquires not with what willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or subiection it be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but the Lord principally sits ouer the <hi>Conscience,</hi> whose conformitie if wanting, he cares not how great our outward sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection be.

               <p n="2">2. Gods Word, which being nothing, but the diuine will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in writing, doth directly binde the hearts of men to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and therefore vses no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence to perswade obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but comes in the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Lord; Thus sayth the

Besides, inspiration its both written and sealed.</p>
               <p>Let not any wonder, why I make God and his Word two distinct binders; sometimes the Lord commandes things not onely diuerse, but contrary to his word; it being our Rule, not his.</p>

                  <hi>Relatiue bond,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is threefold. 1. <hi>The iudiciall Law</hi> once directly bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Conscience</hi> of the <hi>Iewish,</hi> and yet is of force to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, but not simply for it selfe, but in some respects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. So farre as it consents with the Law of nature and Nations, which being of perpetuall equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:27800:93"/>did bind them before <hi>Moses</hi> was borne, and yet stands good to vs for the direction of our liues, as that in <hi>Leu.</hi> 19.32. olde age must be reuerenced, <hi>Thou shalt rise vp before the hoary head;</hi> which we know to be a mutuall debt to olde age: which the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> obserued with great Religion; their <hi>Senate</hi> arising at the entrance of an aged man, though their petitioner: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which practise, its vsuall with vs to call the aged men, <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the elder Matrons, <hi>Mothers:</hi> besides,</p>
               <p n="2">2. It bindes where the reason enforcing it, is of perpetuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, for while the reason stands good, the dutie enforced must needes binde. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.21. Strangers must not be vexed, and the reason is, your selues were strangers; and the Law of Retalion, requires vs to returne loue for loue; yet this rule holds onely in reasons of this nature,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:27800:94"/>to wit, peculiar to the Law they confirme; for we finde that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> is brought to ratifie both Morall and Ceremoniall obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its also of force, where it serues mainely and solely the maintenance of some of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall precepts, which being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the finger of God, are of perpetuall obedince. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.22. Adultery was to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with death, otherwise the seauenth Cōmandement would be of small credite, being so strongly confronted. Lust of all other vices raigning principally in the hearts of men: Besides, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, and the puritie of posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, could not otherwise conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue amongst men, which is well obserued by Diuines, to be the reason why Adultery is named, vnder it all vncleanenesse being forbidden, when yet other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are more hainous, as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy, and beastialitie; neuer the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:27800:94"/>these sinnes doe not so directly fight against societie, which the Law mainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Humane lawes</hi> also are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Relatiue bond,</hi> yet onely by vertue of the Lords tye, who hath inioyned vs obedience to euery ordinance of man. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers.</hi> Rom. 13.1. <hi>And that for Conscience sake.</hi> Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of persons, and offices, being meerely necessary, both in Church and Common-wealth. Now obedience is two-fold, 1. <hi>Actiue,</hi> when we doe the thing commanded; or 2. <hi>Passiue,</hi> when we submit to the penaltie inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the one of these is euer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, or else the authoritie, which is Gods ordinance, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; the former vndue: when</p>
               <p n="1">1. It commands things <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> as the <hi>Popish Continency:</hi> our good God doth so farre compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate humane frailtie, as that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:27800:95"/>he neuer commands <hi>Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi> and if mens Lawes doe, <hi>Conscience</hi> will not stoope, but frustrates them as nullities. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.11.12. Some are vnable to receiue the Rules of <hi>continency,</hi> are so strongly disposed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall offices, that no indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, or Christian endeuour, can coole their naturall heate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When mans Law crosses the direct command of the <hi>Lord,</hi> wherein the <hi>Conscience,</hi> is free, seing the Lord neuer commands two contraries at the same time, &amp; occasion: the <hi>Pharisies</hi> taught, that by offering a gift to their treasury <hi>Corbans,</hi> men were freed from <hi>morall obedience</hi> to, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance of their parents, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.11. Noble therefore was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.29 <hi>Whether it be right to obey God rather then you, iudge ye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. When it infringes <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an libertie,</hi> which the Lord hath purchased by his owne bloud,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:27800:95"/>and as a speciall Royaltie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24. Now here a pertinent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is to be obserued, there <hi>is a libertie to vse,</hi> and the <hi>vse of that libertie,</hi> which differ as much as meat dressed, and the eating of it: the former is a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bequeathed of Christ, and is therefore inuiolable by mans law; but the second being the improouement of that grant, may be restrained without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of the former: where 1. the reason of the Restraint is ciuill, respecting profit, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: 2. Where the doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Adiaphorals</hi> is pure, and incorrupt, according to which the Legall restraint is to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted; as in our <hi>Lenton</hi> fast, the respect is <hi>Ciuill,</hi> the breed of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and maintenance of Trades, and our doctrine teaching no holinesse of times, no impuritie of meates; both which being wanting in the <hi>Popish</hi> obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:27800:96"/>it becomes an offence to the <hi>Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When <hi>humane lawes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand things, though <hi>indifferent</hi> in nature, yet <hi>superstitious</hi> in vse, as hauing in them an Opinion;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Necessitie, as if neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor the being of a church could consist without such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruances, as are left arbitrary by <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>great Doctor in his Church,</hi> who hath made suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent prouision for the ordering thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of Merit, as if hereby wee should deserue ought at the hand of God, which yet is denied our morall obedience, in that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest of vs can giue nothing to God, of <hi>adequate</hi> nature to his grace and crowne; such are the <hi>Romish crossings,</hi> with the retinue of other their superstitions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of holinesse, as if meates did commend vs to God, or the obseruers of such Rites, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy men, and acceptable to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:27800:96"/>God. Thus the <hi>Pharisies</hi> placed Religion in washings, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themselues otherwise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane; and the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> curses al such as omit their trash, as seuerely as any other crimes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Of perfection, as if Gods worship were bettered by mans deuices, or no Church compleat without such forms, as please the palates of some superstitious persons. The Apostle shews, that he which obserues a day to the Lord, or he that obserues it not at all, may both haue equall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God. Many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions haue beene twixt the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine Churches,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the obseruation of <hi>Easter,</hi> and such like things, with such heate, as if no other Church could be Christs spouse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their obseruations.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third <hi>Relatiue bond</hi> is our voluntary oathes, vowes, and promises, which build not for themselues directly, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:27800:97"/>for that the Lord hath bound the heart to truth and Iustice, and partly in that man vpon good consideration hath assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a taske to himselfe, whose will was formerly free herein, <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.25.</p>
               <p>It is a share for a man after a vow to make inquiry, if we haue vowed it is to late to say, did I well? or should I doe it? Seeing Conscience bindes vs euen where we dealt vnaduisedly in our couenant making, yet this binder admits of some limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as</p>
               <p>First, where the person vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or promising, hath not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer his owne head, nor yet commission from such as haue, no man can giue that hee hath not: a Wife, Child, or Seruant may not vow vnlesse they haue first, an expresse or implicit consent from their head, in whose power it is to disanull the vowes they make, <hi>Num.</hi> 30.5.12.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:27800:97"/>secondly, except their vowes be of that nature, that they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerne humane Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>I haue sworne to keepe thy righteous Iudgements;</hi> so they that vow more Christian care in such omissions wherein they haue beene formerly faulty, or to watch their heart more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly then formerly, therein fixing a double pale to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affections, doe well: and no Parent can dispence with this vow, since none but Christ is our head in matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Except the promise be of impossibles, which diuine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie confirmes not, which bindes not to accomplishment, but contrition for our rashnesse, in ensnaring our owne soules; thus the vow of single life, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible without impuritie of heart, and life, to them whom God hath fitted to marriage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: This was <hi>Lathers</hi> case so
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:27800:98"/>much obiected to the disgrace of our faith, <hi>Vowes are Relatiue bonds,</hi> and bind not besides Gods equitie, so that after informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Conscience (so that he did it not grudgingly) and his peace made with God for his former folly in vowing, hee might lawfully violate that vow, which was bred of the <hi>excrements of Superstition, and an erroneous conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Vnlesse the thing vowed be <hi>morally euill,</hi> repentance not performance is due to such rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: thus sinned <hi>Iesabell</hi> in vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Elijahs</hi> death: thus also those fortie, who bound themselues vnder a great curse to kill <hi>Paul,</hi> both which were disappointed of their deuillish intendements: Herein <hi>Herod</hi> might haue done better to haue broken his rash oath, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did concerning the slaughter of <hi>Nabals</hi> house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.22.</p>
               <p>To this two places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ans. </seg>
                  </label> these vowes were to bee kept, not for the binding nature thereof, but in iudgement to the votaries: <hi>Saul</hi> shall be driuen by the guilt of his owne sonne, to see his rashnes in vowing, and the Elders shall smart for their preposterous dealing, and learn hereafter in doubtfull case to inquire of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Besides these things were euill, yet not simply, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afflictions, and inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to the state, which wise Gouernours ought to preuent, how euer that permission of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> was by a speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of the Lord, that none of his people might be put to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:27800:99"/>such base offices, as drawers of water, and bearers of wood were, <hi>Iosu.</hi> 9.21.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Vnlesse the Lord by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prouidence disanull our vowes, by the interposition of some weightier consideration then the vow it selfe is, before the time of accomplishment be expired: <hi>Eleazar Aarons</hi> sonne, promises marriage to a diuorced woman, and in the interim of the nuptials, his two brethren are slaine by Gods Immediate hand, and he by a diuine neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity called to the office of the High Priest, who by a speciall law was forbidden marriage in this nature, so that now his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer yow was out of date, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29.1. <hi>Dauid</hi> sweares to keepe the head of the King his master, to whom now he was fled, and might doe it to him as a King, though not as an enemy to Gods Church, and therefore might not haue borne armes against
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:27800:99"/>Gods people, which the Nobles fearing caused his dismission; but before, <hi>Ziglag</hi> shall smart for his attempt against Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

               <p>Where there is a confusion of duties,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is no distinction of Couenants, but twixt the Law and the Gospell, there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of duties, <hi>ergo:</hi> for the first, Duties being mans restipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, doe mainely tend to the effence of the Couenant inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For the second, the Gospell requires perfectiō of obedience as well as the Law: <hi>Be ye perfect as my heauenly Father is perfect: Finally Brethren be perfect, and perfecting holinesse.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1.

               <p n="4">4. The Law was giuen in the hands of a Mediator, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,

               <p n="3">3. Some also seeme to obiect the Apostles mention of a first and second Couenant, out of the Prophets. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1. &amp; 8.6. True, he doth, but in a diuerse sense, his first and olde Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was, the shadowes typify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ, his new and better, Christ in open vision manifested more clearely, and with a larger dispensation of grace, which is the Apostles scope Conclude we then that <hi>Conscience</hi> is bound to the obseruance of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, or faith in Christ, and to respect the Law as a Rule of obedience, judge, and reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of sinne, and as a scourge of our owne righteousnesse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of God to lead vs to Christ, not to justifie vs in it selfe. These things may not seeme strange, euery truth is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and publicke, neither haue I first broken the Ice herein, or
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27800:103"/>done any thing without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of better heads; I doubt not but others will take occasion to discusse this difference more accurately, more fully.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How requisite it is, that Christians should be acquainted with Case-diuinitie, seing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> is bound, whether wee know it or no. Were we sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for a debt, wee would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our selues of the summe, the time, and place of payment; and shall we be so ignorant of the debt of obedience we owe to God, especially, it concerning the crowne of glory, &amp; the debt far lesse then might be exacted of vs? What Art is there so meane, but it hath a <hi>Mystery</hi> in it, which is learned onely by practice therein? And what worke is there worth a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an endeuour, wherein there needes not great knowledge, for the right carriage thereof? How diligent then should we be, least
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:27800:104"/>our good workes be miscarried; some Rules are to be obserued concerning the obiect of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>Gods commandement,</hi> seing it neuer bindes besides its owne <hi>equitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Euery particular Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement binds besides or against the generall, it being indeede a secret <hi>Implication</hi> in the generall, vnlesse I command thee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Thus the <hi>Israelites</hi> might purloyne, and cheate the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> contrary to the Law, <hi>Thou shalt not steale;</hi> and that man that refused to smite the Prophet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cald thereto by a <hi>particular iniunction</hi> against the generall, was therefore slaine of a Lyon, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Two duties neuer meete; duties they may be distinctly considered, but as they concur, both calling for obseruance at the same instant, they are not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the one of them yeelds; and the execution of the yeelding
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:27800:104"/>duties for the present, hath reason of an offence. The <hi>Leuite</hi> seing the wounded man, might haue beene at a greater stand, whether he was to abstaine a legall pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or shew mercy to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in misery; and indeed his legall strictnesse, otherwise a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, here was a vice, so that, that Rule, which some Diuines haue, that <hi>Negatiues</hi> alwayes bind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not, that they are of an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable</hi> nature, but that euery particular instance of time, is to be obserued for their obedience, while and where they stand of force.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The more and the more weightie respects, sway our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in a case of opposition: all the duties of the first Table take place of those in the second, prouided that there be an equall <hi>opposition;</hi> and so also each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement preuailes before any that follow after it, in the same respects compared. Thus, Atheis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:27800:105"/>is the highest breach, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry greater then Murther; and faith in the true God, to be performed before-obedience to our parents, or subiection to our Magistrates; yea, the duties of each Commandement are to be scanned by this Rule: obedience to Magistrates, takes place of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to parents; subiection to parents, swayes subiection to Maisters, all other things being equall.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Such Commandements as are of particular equitie, are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable by vs in a case of supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour equitie to that vpon which they were first grounded. The consecrate Bread must not be conuerted to any common vse, yet it selfe became in nature cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread for the sustenance of <hi>Dauids</hi> life. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.5. a farre superior cause to any ceremonial equitie. Againe, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might not obserue any <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremonies, least hereby they
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:27800:105"/>should harden the <hi>Iewes</hi> in their worships, now antiquated; yet if it may appeare that the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of <hi>Timothy,</hi> may be an occasion of the bringing in of many weake <hi>Iewes,</hi> that former bond ceases, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.3. This he did as a <hi>Gentile,</hi> in that for a <hi>Iew</hi> to be Circumcised, was no yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and those words, they all knew his father was a <hi>Greeke,</hi> demonstrate, he went in estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Gentile,</hi> according to the Law of Nations, following his fathers right.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whensoeuer the equitie of any Commandement ceases, the Law it selfe expires; as, the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Ierusalem</hi> forbid the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> the <hi>eating of blood, and things strangled,</hi> because of the cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who were to be forborne while the Temple stood, and vntill that generation were dead, which sometimes saw the Ceremonies of force; for these had some occasion of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:27800:106"/>stumbling at the Law of their annihillation, and so did beare the repute of weake brethren; but when the perfect age was expired, and the equitie of that restraint ceasing, the Law it selfe perished with the vse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not bind vs <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the like obseruation, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.20.21. And in this case there needs not, as in the former, any superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or reason, the ground-worke and structure falling both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>A third thing we are informed in from the bond of <hi>Conscience</hi> is,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Infor. </seg>3</label> what a Labyrinth sin brings wicked men into, they are bound to beleeue euery title, and iot of the Word, euen those curses and censures, as make directly for their own condemnation, which yet if they deny to doe, this their refusall to credit the Lord, is damnable, had they no other sinnes. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:27800:106"/>
               <p>Likewise, in case of sinfull <hi>vowes,</hi> they incurre the high dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God, by obseruing of their promises, and by breach of them they gore themselues vpon the Pikes of an accusing <hi>Conscience.</hi> Let others deeme what they please, concerning the content they finde in sinne; we know it an euill and bitter thing, and will proue so to them, when the bottome of the bagge is shaken vp. But alas I charme a deafe Adder, they will not heare the newes of their owne misery. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.19.</p>
               <p>The vses further that arise from <hi>Conscience</hi> bond,
<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> are of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whatsoeuer we doe, let vs doe it in reference to God, seing he is the onely commander of our <hi>Consciences;</hi> euen those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue bonds we haue heard of, haue their dependance of the Lord, from whom they receiue their binding nature; so then
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:27800:107"/>though we immediately obey man, and performe ciuill offices to them; yet by doing it for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> of God, thereby our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill imployments become good workes, and we maintaine our walke with God, euen there, where he seemes farthest from his creature. What though our callings are diuerse from Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we tyed to attendance on our callings? Yet may we by this heauenly mindednesse, as freely conuerse with God, as if we attended daily about his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate worship, in that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him in his workes, and doe all things in reference to him that is <hi>inuisible.</hi> Col. 3.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It exhorts to encourage our hearts against the frownes of the world, that we incurre by the keeping of a good <hi>Conscience,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are not our owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters herein, but are bound to doe what we doe, which is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient plea, A seruant after the

Is there not a Iudge, a Reward, and a day of Reckoning, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie onely will take place? Why should we then giue way to such base feares, seeing we haue an euidence in the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of our opposers themselues. <hi>Act.</hi> 4 16.</p>

               <p>Secondly, some haue the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of Christ imputed to them, whereby they are dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the debt of sinne: al hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writings of accusations being cancelled, they are esteemed, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vnblameable in the sight of God, so that Conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Deputy, must needes haue its mouth stopped, the Lord himselfe hauing sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs an acquittance of the debt of sinne, and receiued vs into grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>When wee are iustified by Christ, peace with God followes as a necessary effect,</hi> and by consequence a freedome from further annoyance by his Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife errand Conscience.</p>

Thus <hi>Iob</hi> being conscious of his owne innocency, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from so good a cause, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the sophistry of his three friendes, <hi>Iob.</hi> 27.5.6.</p>

               <p>For the illustration of this goodnes of Conscience, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite we consider first, the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated goodnes it possessed in the state of <hi>Integritie.</hi> Secondly, its acquired goodnes since the fall, wherein as in a glasse wee may see this goodnes in hand: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the created goodnes, we haue the lesse to say, the state of our pure naturals, being sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled in the Scripture, yet what wee may by good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence deduct, is of speciall vse.</p>

               <p>The vses arising from the created goodnesse of the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> are onely for our Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Excellent estate wherein we were first created, hauing not onely many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faculties, but also rectitude and order: Order, whereby each

The spirit of God seemes straitned, how to find out fit tearmes to discipher this contagion, calling it <hi>filthy ragges.</hi> Isa. 64.6. <hi>The scumme of a pot,</hi> Ezek. 24.6. <hi>The blood of natiuitie.</hi> Ezek. 16.6. <hi>Dogs vomit,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. last. <hi>Rottennosse,</hi> Eph 4.22.29. And <hi>vncleanenesse,</hi> Zach. 13.1. <hi>Our fathers haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sowre grapes, and our teeth are set on edge.</hi> The same diuine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, that propagated <hi>Gehezies Leprosie</hi> to his posteritie, hath also brought such a curse on naturall generatio, that as soone as he is a person, he becomes most filthy and abhominable in Gods sight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It informes vs of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse wee shall enioy, when Gods image shall be compleate in vs, and we partakers of the immediate vision of God. <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of Innocency, had
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:27800:114"/>but the grace of Creation, yet we heare of the excellency of one facultie onely, whereby he was enabled fearelesly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse with God. What thinke wee will be our blessednesse, when to this created perfection, and that in equall degree, there shall be added the grace of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;</hi> our nature assumed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and we more nearely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited then <hi>Adam</hi> euer was, or could be. This I speake, not to vilifie the happinesse of that earthly Paradise, wherein was sealed eternall happinesse, vpon condition of obedience. The <hi>tree of life,</hi> was so called, either for some naturall vertue it had to bestow life, or else as a signe and Sacrament thereof. 1. If as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a naturall vigor, to viuifie and quicken, it had beene God, seing nothing but God hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally power of life and death. 2. God needed not haue brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed into man that breath of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:27800:115"/>life, but onely haue put one of those Apples into his mouth. 3. It was so a tree of life, as the forbidden fruit grew on the <hi>tree of knowledge;</hi> but it was not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, a fruit bestowing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge notionall, and by the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but onely by accident; man by experience finding the good of obedience, and euill of diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: <hi>it remaines then that it was a tree of life by diuine dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> a cause by councell, not nature, and therefore must seale spirituall grace, euen all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Couenant, <hi>I will be thy God, and thou shalt be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Man had happinesse sealed then: but in the state of glory, all these Sacraments, which are but supplements of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, shall expire in immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate vision of God in Christ. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The meanes are two fold.
<note place="margin">Meanes.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Adiutory, preparing, and helping forward this puritie.</p>
               <p>Or 2. Effectuall, which strike the stroake, and indeede stampe the impression of grace vpon it.</p>
               <p>The Adiutory meanes are these:
<note place="margin">Helping.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Education, is a speciall helpe, not onely to procure common ciuilitie, but much
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:27800:116"/>furthers the happinesse of this, and hopes of a better life; which hath moued some to say, that <hi>Education</hi> differences man from man, as much as Reason distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes him from a bruite beast. Now this Education of youth, hath three members.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Common restraint of youth from following their swing in youthfull lustes, in their Ales, greenes, and May-games, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, besides the dishonor to God, and wound of <hi>Conscience,</hi> they oft with <hi>Dinah,</hi> blemish their names, with no lesse then the losse of their honestie; is there not a bundle of folly in the heart of youth, which by seasonable Restraint must be suppressed? What got <hi>Dauid,</hi> by his cocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his <hi>Adonijah,</hi> were not his life, and kingdome in hazard by his insolency? But especially his white sonne <hi>Absolon,</hi> so faire a youth, the cold winde might not blow vpon him. But what
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:27800:116"/>thanke he had returned, let his mōstrous crueltie, against a more then tender <hi>Father</hi> witnesse. To say nothing of <hi>Elies</hi> sonnes. Gods dishonor by them, or their Fathers smart for conniuence; Experience at home will witnes, that youth neglected, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in vnbridled lusts,
<note place="margin">Pro. 29.15.</note> and not onely proue the bane of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, but cursed Incendiaries, to the fayrest state. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Instruction in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Arts,</hi> both <hi>Liberall</hi> and <hi>Mechanicall;</hi> by the one, the judgement is informed in what is mainely good, or euill; by the other, the person is exercised in some wholesome labour, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the common good. Hence arises that commendable prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Instructors of youth, to teach them such Authors, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them both in the knowledge of tongues, and Arts; as also to furnish them with such morall obseruations, as may further the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:27800:117"/>ordering of their whole liues. In the Precepts of which nature, some of the Philosophers haue excelled, as <hi>Plato, Seneca, Cicero;</hi> of whom, one saith, they haue more fully directed vnto ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and justice, then all the large Volumes of the Schoole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, compared together, who indeed conuert all Diuinitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to questions;
<note place="margin">Pro. 22.6.</note> quirkes rather, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard knotts, that they may haue the glory of vnknitting them againe: meane while, the Practicall part is neglected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Catechizing in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion.</hi> Truth it is, we cannot conuert the heart, nor put new qualities into men; yet may we drop some knowledge into their mindes, whereby they may get <hi>Conscience</hi> of good and euill, or else be left more in excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable. The <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> after long profession, were so ignorant of the Word, and through neglect of this dutie so vnfit, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:27800:117"/>could not impart to them some things,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.11</note> that might haue been very comfortable, had they bin capable of them; yea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet they were but babes, they might haue beene strong men, hauing their senses (or Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) exercised to discerne good and euill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Afflictions are of speciall vse, to forward this purity in the heart of man, for by sense of smart, the sensuall part is tamed, and now made pliable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. In prosperitie, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are so pampered, that they mind no further felicitie, and are aduerse to the very motions of heauenly things, but when they are crosse whetted, &amp; their edge taken off by some afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they grow tractable to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hearing, and other Christian duties; which causes the <hi>Prophet</hi> to affirme of these men, though in the land of vprightnesse, they will sinne against God, yet when
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:27800:118"/>they are vnder the rod, they will powre out a prayer to God. <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.10.15. Our owne experience may witnesse, <hi>the rod and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, giue wisedome,</hi> sith few are brought to a thorow rellish of Religion, till troubles haue taught them a more narrow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and a deeper degree of mortification. Hence a voice is ascribed to the Rod, <hi>Heare the rod, and who hath sent it.</hi> Mich. 6.9. Hence <hi>Correction</hi> is called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> which yet is but the effect of it, and that passiuely, as dead pillars doe liuing passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.18.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Those notions of nature, which are left in vs, doe further our vnderstanding of diuine mysteries; Diuinitie being not contrary, onely diuerse, &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent to reason. Hence we see men of education, or learning, as in Citties, are more tractable to the embracement of the truth, then others that follow a priuate
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:27800:118"/>and Rusticke life. Some thing there is in our diuine nature, that may be called light (if the light that is in you be darkenesse) which when it meetes with the grace of <hi>sanctification,</hi> is very vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our Christian perfection. Mans corrupt will being (not like a blocke, or stone rather) as a wilde Horse, turned from God the Rider, which being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-awed, becomes as seruicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as euer it was before opposite to God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.27.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The last helpe is, those common and repressing graces, which God vouchsafeth to his very enemies, such as conuiction of judgement, temporary faith, gifts of prayer, and profession. In respect whereof, <hi>Saul</hi> is sayd to haue a new heart giuen him, a change there was indeed from that that was before, not to that he should be. Hence it is, that these whited Sepulchers, cannot in outward view, be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:27800:119"/>from the Lords Iesurun, and vpright hearted Christians, so neare doth semblance represent substance, and so farre doth hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie (sincerities Ape) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the way of Religion, that a man would thinke, they had gotten the true stampe of pietie indeed, yet these graces do serue to inlighten the mind, though the heart be yet contained. <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.18. Gifts of grace are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the Rebellious, that God might dwell on earth, in his Religion, and worshippers.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the Meanes effectuall, whereby this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is conuayed to the soules of men; they are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Externall, incurring the senses;</p>
               <p>Or 2.
<note place="margin">Effectuall.</note> Internall, speaking to the <hi>Conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the outward Meanes, they are either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Word of God, which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:27800:119"/>is the Rule of renued <hi>Conscience,</hi> being the Oracles of God, and the Conduit pipe of grace and saluation; hereby the minde is furnished with store of <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> the will made flexible to good, and affections moderated by right reason. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy Word; thy Word is truth:</hi> by this onely the Lord speakes to the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> When <hi>Elijah</hi> was in the Caue, the <hi>Lord passing by him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King 19.11.12.</note>
                  <hi>was not in the Thunder, nor light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but in the still soft voyce;</hi> to shew, that he had sanctified a voyce to be the ordinary meane of comming to his creature, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering the strong holds of sin, &amp; principalities of hel in vs: this, is that <hi>Balme</hi> of <hi>Gilead,</hi> sufficient to refresh the wearied soule. The neglect of this, is the ground of error, both in faith &amp; manners. The acquaintance hereof, is the onely way to lasting peace, both with God and our owne hearts.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:27800:120"/>
               <p n="2">2. The Sacraments of the Lords Institution, which being visible words, doe represent to our senses, the vnutterable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of our saluation; by which Christ is said to be Crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Galatians,</hi> his violent death being set forth thereby, as familiarly, as if they had beene eye witnesses of his extreame pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; yea, Sacraments haue also a cleansing power, to purge vs of the filth of sinne, not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall thing, or bare Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but the spirituall vse, applying the inuisible grace, Christs death, and bloudshed, to the killing of corruption. Our Apostle instructing <hi>Titus</hi> in the meanes of saluation,
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.5.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, mentions Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, calling it the <hi>washing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> for that it both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles, and seales the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. The like is the efficacy of the Lords Supper, confirming to, and bestowing on vs the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:27800:120"/>of our redemption; Christ himselfe being truely exhibited to the worthy Receiuer. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.</p>
               <p>For the effectuall inward Meanes; they are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The bloud of Christ, which is the onely salue to the <hi>Conscience,</hi> burthened with the filth and guilt of sinne, all other Plaisters doe but daube with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered morter, all other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are but as cold water to an aguish stomacke, making the wound greater. To this purpose its recorded in a <hi>French Comedy,</hi> whose subiect is <hi>Conscience,</hi> that amongst other Actors, there comes vpon the stage one acting the part of an accusing, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>Conscience,</hi> who runnes vp and downe, chafing and bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a wild Bull in a Net, at length falles into the company of swaggerers, and playes the Ruffian, swearing, and swilling with the thickest of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:27800:121"/>at <hi>Conscience</hi> was more enraged, new occasions of vexation being added, then he runs to the Dice and Tables, but could not stay the game out: so furious was he, then gets him into his counting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, amongst his bils and bonds: yet there he found no ease, till his friends send him to buy a pardon, which hanging about his necke, he comes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing on the stage, but this Ioy was soone cooled: at last he goes to Christ by humble confession, and prayer, and there his former disquiet was so calmed, that he was as meeke as a Lambe. Thus if we goe to the Iles of <hi>Chittim,</hi> we may find witnesses enough of this truth; persons of this qualitie, are least sensible of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> working in them, yet you see they grant, that nothing can salue the troubled soule, but the bloud of Christ; whose eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though not diuine, yet may strike through the sides of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:27800:121"/>vnconscionable men, one of their owne commending the bloud of Christ, whose applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they vtterly reiect; and yet its not contrary to the Word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging no other Hyssop, but the bloud of the <hi>Immaculate Lambe of God.</hi> Heb. 4.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The spirit of Christ, who for the vnspeakeable solace, he ministers to the troubled soule, its witnessed to be that <hi>Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> whose still voyce to our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> assuring the debt of sin to be discharged, and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall acquittance with God: whence arises such vnspeakeable Ioy, and peace in the heart of a Christian, that his soule feasts in midst of feares. Besides, Gods spirit is the next and immediate applier of the promises of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without which worke we could neuer taste the sweetnesse of those blessings, which Christ hath purchased for vs: the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled heart writes bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:27800:122"/>against it selfe, till the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apply mercy, yea <hi>tis the spirits oyntment,</hi> whereby such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent graces, are wrought in vs, wherby we are taught all things necessary to saluation, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in vs, we are vpheld in the truth: <hi>this is that good Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane,</hi> whose wine and oyle doth supple the wounded soule of a Christian. 2 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.27.</p>
               <p>For vse, these meanes of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie serue to teach vs,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Parents,

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:27800:123"/>of God, to turne our nature vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side downe, while our common Protestant vses Religion as a matter of pollicy, as an inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to keepe men within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of Ciuilitie: the word of Gods grace is disgraced, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments prophaned, and Gods reuealed will (as the Papists speake) is made Inky diuinity, and a Nose of wax, bending which way the wheele of our priuate wils doe moue. This slighting Gods ordinances, this superficiall worship is the maine barre to the happinesse of many thousands, <hi>God is neere in their mouthes, but farre from their Reines,</hi> and their hearts sealed, that <hi>seeing they see and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue:</hi> Consider we 1. a Sauiour is vouchsafed <hi>Man,</hi> a benefit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed <hi>Angels</hi> partakers in the same transgression, and more immediate attendants on Gods glory, <hi>and shall wee neglect so great saluation,</hi> so free, so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="4">4. Good <hi>Conscience</hi> is stirring, and liuely, laying the filthinesse of sinne in the dish of the sinner; sin is sweet to the heart of man, but it will make it, but a bitter-sweet; there is such a deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie befallen mans nature, that he is now brought vnder a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of sinning, yet herein shines
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:27800:127"/>the great goodnesse of the Lord, that he hath set a light in mans heart, to discouer to himselfe his fals, and also to preuent his set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the lees of iniquitie, that he wallow not, or tumble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the puddle of sin; when the heate of lust is ouer-blowne, <hi>Conscience</hi> takes the sinner aside, and schools him for his folly, <hi>setting before the vglinesse of sinne, Gods iustice, the price of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and raritie of sound Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Good <hi>Conscience</hi> is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bending after perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being not content with the forme, it followes hard on to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the power of godlinesse; the more means it hath of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, the more principles it gets, the more light, the more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, watchfulnesse, and life. Its none of those, who pride themselues in their owne parts, that it hath, is nothing in its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; so large is the desire of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:27800:128"/>more. Much lesse is it of their number, that are at a stand, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round in a race, like the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse; whence it is that <hi>Pouertie of spirit is a note of truth in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall graces.</hi> Psal. 119.32. When <hi>Dauid is set at libertie, he will run the way of Gods Commandements;</hi> wheras now it finds much cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and benummednes in Gods seruice, when once it shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, it intends to better his former zeale. <hi>Paul</hi> also is so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of perfection, <hi>he forgets all his former performances, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing still forward after a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of holines,</hi> Phil. 3.14.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Good <hi>Conscience</hi> is tender, and passible, euery vnkindnesse offered, will wound it deepely; we say the eye is a tender thing, and easily hurt, but the <hi>Conscience</hi> much more, and therfore it must be tenderly dealt with, or else it may be sooner broken then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yea, so tender that a good heart is more apt a thousand
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:27800:128"/>times to offend in scruple, in binding it selfe with lawes of its owne inuention, then in libertie of sinne, whereof the tempter is well aware, and therefore takes occasion to driue some to sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, others to grosser impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thus it was with <hi>Timothy,</hi> who dwelling with the dissolute <hi>Ephesians</hi> (who were so debosht, that hauing but one <hi>Hermod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7 Lastly, good <hi>Conscience</hi> is victorious, nothing can blunt the edge of its Reproofes, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent affections may fill the heart with such a noyse, that its ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rums, though neuer so loud,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:27800:129"/>cannot be heard, (like those that dwell at the fall of <hi>Nilus,</hi> in whose eares we must shout, or they cannot heare) yet doth it not desist smiting, nor yet by silence giue an allowance, where it sees iust cause of distast. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable is <hi>Conscience</hi> courage herein, in that like <hi>Hydras</hi> head, it gathers strength and courage afresh, by euery wound it hath. When vnbridled lusts doe sway, and its wholesome counsell is drowned in deepe securitie, it layes about it more furious then euer, and neuer giues vs rest, vntill it haue driuen vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that vnto all our sinnes we added this one. <hi>Dauid</hi> about the space of a yeare, was in a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all slumber, neglecting <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> voyce in him. But what did it all this while? Was it asleepe? No, it gaue him no rest in his bones, it was like a disease, or rottennesse in him, and driues him to Confession in spight of

               <p>These properties of a good <hi>Conscience,</hi>

<note place="margin">Infor.</note> these properties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate what tender respect there should be had to tender <hi>Consciences,</hi> both by Magistrats and Ministers, the one in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the word, must not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer violence to the Law, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the entire meaning, <hi>to make sad the hearts of the righteous,</hi> but as the nurse doth beare with the frowardnes of the Infant, and

               <p n="1">1. The Parties, in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:27800:132"/>conflict that are combatants in this Ciuill warre, are the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, and inferior parts of the soule; on the one side the Mind and Conscience dislike the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of euill: on the other side, the Will and Affections are tooth and nayle for it, so that here the contention is twixt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fferent faculties; the <hi>Conscience</hi> as a churlish master, holdes a cudgell ouer vnruly affections, and the lustfull heart of man crouches and dares not touch the sweete of sinne, for feare of a rap, when as yet the appetite is still as greedie as euer, 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Hazaell, while Conscience did dominere in him, seemes to wonder at the presage of his mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous cruelty, but when lust had wrung the cudgell out of his hand, he presently goes home and strangles his master, and fulfils the same crueltie foretold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the spirituall conflict it is otherwise, the very same
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:27800:132"/>faculties are opposed, each being partly renewed, and partly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified; <hi>Conscience</hi> partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murres, partly approues, <hi>Will</hi> partly wils that is good, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nils it; <hi>Affections</hi> doe in part embrace, and in part retire from the same obiect; man consisting of two contrarie natures, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part hauing a relish of both, neither corruption nor grace, doth freely chuse what it affects, but is resisted by the aduers part, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Wherein a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an resembles a sicke person, who partly through Physitians per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion wils such a receipt, and partly nils it, for that his stomack being squeamish, distastes such slibber sauces, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.13. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be seene in the Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, but the appearance of two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, maintaining ciuil broyles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 There is difference in the obiects about which they doe contend, the naturall <hi>Conscience</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:27800:133"/>onely struggles with crimes of a grosser nature, such as are direct breaches of the second Table, which the notions of nature see to be both euill and infamous, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4. The Pagans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, discerne murther to be a sinne, and iudge it worthy to be prosecuted by some immediate vengeance from God, but for <hi>Atheisme,</hi> and plurality of Gods, they make no bones, they were as ready to call <hi>Paul</hi> a God, as a murtherer; these are like a man going forth in the breake of the day, who can discerne nothing but great obiects, trees and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; lesser things are hidden from his sight.</p>
               <p>But the obiect of the renued conflict is all sinne, as well lesser as greater, seing all hath that in it, that giues being to sin, which is the forme, <hi>a transgression of the Law of God:</hi> So then be it but the first motion of sin, it knowes it proceedes from the spawne of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:27800:133"/>naturall <hi>Concupiscence,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is at daggers drawing with it in the very entrance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7.9. <hi>When Paul had learned that the first motions of sinne were sinne,</hi> his <hi>Conscience</hi> forth with reuiued sinne in sense, and appearance, and hee died in pride and selfe-iustice, this I may fitly compare to a prospectiue glasse, by which a man may discerne distinctly a small thing a farre of, as well as a great, euen so renued <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> makes the least sinne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There is difference in the motiues, and occasions which breede this debate in the heart of man: Naturall <hi>Conscience</hi> stirs against sinne for the shame of the world, danger, and losse, or at the least the terrors of hell: it likes the pleasure of sinne well enough, but because it hath a filthie traine, and stinges mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally after a momentary pleasure, therefore <hi>Conscience</hi> wil not giue
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:27800:134"/>way to it; this motiue, one of Natures schollers could obserue, euill men forbeare to sinne for feare of paine, good men for loue of vertue, but will you heare a notable Churle in his owne language, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.5. <hi>Though I feare not God, nor reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence man, yet because this woman keepes such a bauling, I will right her:</hi> honor, or pleasure, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or ease are the motiues, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man vses.</p>
               <p>But the motiues prouoking renued <hi>Conscience</hi> to storme at sinne, are of an higher straine, as the displeasure of God, scandall of Religion, loue of Christ, and the comfort of the spirit: <hi>how shall I doe this euill and sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God,</hi> saith <hi>Ioseph: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I should sinne against God, in ceasing to pray for you: if I should say thus, I should sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the generation of thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Psal. 73.15. <hi>Wee are dead to sinne, no more to liue the life of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:27800:134"/>sinne,</hi> Rom. 6.2. As for shame and losse it sayes, let it smart hardly, if it will needes be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; breifly, the loue of Christ constraines the one, the feare of hell the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4 They differ in the weapons of their warfare with sinne, the one vses carnall, the other spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall engines: The Naturall <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> to suppresse lust, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses others smart for the like cause, <hi>Had Zimri peace that slue his master;</hi> such and such by Ryot haue decayed their estates, blemished their names, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired their strength: others by Idlenesse haue brought their families to beggery, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues knocked their heads at Tyburne: or else it proposes our owne experience; what shame, and trouble wee haue come to by such like prankes: or lastly, from the impossibility of the fact, <hi>Actes</hi> 5.39. <hi>Theudas</hi> smarted for such a practise, <hi>Let
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:27800:135"/>them alone, least happily yee bee found fighters against God,</hi> besides his curse, you will for euer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase disgrace to your selues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vtterly vnable to preuaile.</p>

               <p>Againe, to embrace Religion, and a holy life, with much eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in himselfe, and applause from others, is no such great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. <hi>Iehu, Alexander,</hi> and the <hi>Thorny ground in the Parable, will doe as much;</hi> the manner here also is that which beares the bell away: if it be done in selfe-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in loue of the truth, in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> of God, onely, or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, it shewes the zeale of the Lord, being maintained to the end, with life and growth.

               <p>The fourth thing proposed,

<note place="margin">Effects.</note> some of the speciall whereof, are these,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Discouery of the hidden man of the heart: there is no clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set of the soule so intricate, but it peirces into it, to discerne what order or disorder is kept therein; by science, a man lookes abroad to forraine obiects, and seeth all things but himselfe; by <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> a man lookes home, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines what is in himselfe; and in this priuy search, where it finds any vertue, or fruits of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse worth a Christians heart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> treasures it vp for necessary vse, some for encouragement, some for Consolation; but if it can discerne any secret pride, earthlinesse, or frowardnesse of heart, it makes them appeare
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:27800:140"/>most ominous, &amp; pursues them with as much detestation, as if it were witchcraft, or murther, or such like capitall crimes; this discouery the <hi>Apostle</hi> ascribes to the spirit of man, to wit, <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> in him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A recond effect is recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after fals, a man could not chuse but perish, and sinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sinne, were it not for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> which being tender, and liuely, suffers vs not to sleepe in security, but when it hath Mans heart at an aduantage, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing way of sensualitie, being hedged with the thornes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and now it is full tide with our lustfull heart, it then layes before vs the dishonor of God, wound of the spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, the danger of Apostacy, &amp; endlesse misery the of vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and with these, and other like Incentiues sends vs to the fountaine of mercy by sorrow, and confession, without which
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:27800:141"/>we were vtterly lost, but he that is held vp by the chin, cannot easily drowne; Gods spirit and our owne, deny finall Apostacy to the Elect called, being built on the rocke Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3 A third effect is spirituall life in time of tentation, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, when the whole man is carried captiue by some strong suggestion, will, and affections, yeelding themselues vassals of hell, the senses, and members weapons of vnrighteousnesse, and all life of grace seemes vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost; yet <hi>Conscience</hi> alone cleaues to the Lord: as it fals out with vs in some imminent danger, all the blood recoyles to the heart: so here Sinceritie retires to the fort of <hi>Conscience,</hi> and there strugles, and reluctes, chosing rather to die then yeeld; so that a Christian may be sayd to be in a swoone, there being no outward appearance of life, onely the pulse beates in euery
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:27800:141"/>part of man: his <hi>Conscience</hi> striues for life, thus it fared with the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.2. <hi>I sleepe, but my heart waketh:</hi> ouercome I am by coolenes of zeale, yet not transformed into sins Image, for my heart and <hi>Conscience</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines life and puritie still.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Another effect of renued <hi>Conscience,</hi> is Zeale in Religion. mans heart is naturally indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to good, and cold in furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any good cause, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Conscience</hi> your Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which by discoursing from the commandement, findes it the most excellent imployment, and hath the promise of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie made ouer to it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perswades vs to bestow our hearts, and vttermost endenour in following so holy a course: these dissolute times charge Gods Saints with wilfulnes, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity, and the spirit of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity; whereas it is merely <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> of duty, that we outstrip
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:27800:142"/>others of our Rancke: <hi>The zeale of the Lord hath caten vp, and leauened Christians so, that they cannot serue the times with others:</hi> Dauid <hi>resoluing to be silent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst wicked company,</hi>

               <p n="5">5 Inward peace and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of spirit, is a speciall effect of a good <hi>Conscience,</hi> it onely can still the heart, and minister a full repast of comfort in time of outward calamities: from its strength it is, that the heart is enabled to liue by faith, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string assurance of the eternity of Gods loue, of the certainty of the promise, and of the Lords hand stretched forth for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his cause, he that is at peace with God, and his owne <hi>Conscience,</hi> needeth not to feare <hi>though the gates of hell, and death

               <p n="6">6. The last Effect of good <hi>Conscience,</hi> is assistance till Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; It will neuer leaue vs, till the Grand Commander of all hearts, hath heard and approued Its witnesse: Friends, honors, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, attend vs but to the graue, prouiding in lieu of our seruice, we be honorably enterred; but it stickes to vs in the graue: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and Iudgement, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in our hearts such bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and confidence in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of heauen and earth, as is wonderfull: When the Ruffians of the world, who seeme to be men of resolution, and vndaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hearts, shall tremble euery joynt of them, as men at their wits end, <hi>Good Conscience shall haue ioy and game, sith its saluation

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:27800:150"/>and a Table after shipwracke to the humbled soule, and what not? The greatest blessing that euer God bestowed on man, (excepting his Christ) either in his integritie, or fallen; who would not then endeuour the fruition of it. There are two things vsually whet on mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, raritie, difficultie; which both doe most sweetly concurre in this prize of a good <hi>conscience.</hi> Now seing this purchase is most excellent, let me prouoke you hereto by these motiues.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Motiues.</note> A pure <hi>Conscience</hi> hath a witnesse in euery mans bosome, it needs not goe far for euidence, to prooue the equitie it hath, its very enemies will witnesse with it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Paul approoues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to euery mans conscience,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did adulterate his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
<note place="margin">Deu. 32.30</note> or no. The Church of God appeales for Arbitrement to her enemies, who yet could not gainesay her, as ppeared by their feares, in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:27800:150"/>
               <p n="2">2. A good <hi>Conscience</hi> giues vs title to, and pure vse of all the creaiures of God: Man by the fall, lost his interest, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the creatures, which he neuer recouers, till he be in <hi>Christ,</hi> by whom our losse in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> is made good to vs againe. A wicked, &amp; vnregenerate man, holds his possessions onely by the tenure of vsurpation, who though he feed on the blessings of God, yet his title is crazed, in that he neither <hi>knowes, nor obeyes the truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A good <hi>Conscience</hi> can judge it selfe, and all things else, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a direct line; the rule and bond of euery mans <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is the same, so that he which hath acquaintance with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of right Reason, can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what himselfe is bound to, and all others besides; also what it selfe was in the time of natural vncleannesse, and consequently, what all others in the same state
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:27800:151"/>are; yet is it not liable to any censure, but Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It onely hath truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner parts; others may haue God in their mouthes, when yet he is farre off from their reines,</hi> but the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the true Conuert, are they of the hidden man of the heart; let the vnfound professor stand vpon forme, retaining in his heart the stumbling blocke of some loue-sin, yet it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the soule for an habitation to the Lord of glory: and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewes, tis a question whether the desire of being, or the dislike of seeming sincere, be greater in it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, the more puritie thy <hi>Conscience</hi> hath in it, the more it is like God, growing in degrees of holinesse, till it haue filled vp that measure allotted to it in the body of Christ; now it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained abilitie to approue, will, and affect that which is good, and onely that ordinarily, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirously,

               <p n="1">1. This consummate blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse consistes in perfection of knowledge, both for the things discerned, as also the certainety, and measure of the knowledge of them; here we determine of things darkly, and weakly; there the mind shall clearely, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly judge of what euer may
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:27800:152"/>further blessednes; all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we haue in the way, we know how we come by it; our sweetest dayes haue beene spent in <hi>Artes,</hi> and yet what we know is the least part of that we might; there all ordinances and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline shall cease, our immediate vnion with God, is the fountaine of heauenly Illumination, and the perfection of Gods Image shall dispell the mistes of error, and ignorance. <hi>Peter</hi> beholding a glimpse of Christs glory on earth, was in an extasie carried beyond himselfe, and without instruction, could denominate <hi>Meses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> that talked with Christ. And the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. concludes, <hi>Our knowledge though sanctified, to be but darkly through a glasse,</hi> there compleate, <hi>face to face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This knowledge is increased indeed (say the <hi>Papistes</hi>) yet not by vertue of our vnion,

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>
                  </label> or the encrease of the habit, but speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:27800:153"/>in regard of the <hi>Medium,</hi> through which the eye of their vnderstanding looketh, to wit, the glasse of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> through which they discerne not onely themselues, and other heauenly things, but also all things on earth besides.</p>
               <p>Which figment at the last cast,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ans. </seg>
                  </label> they haue inuented to prop their Inuocation of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> for answer, let it be obserued,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they make God but the helper onely, and not the primary cause of Illumination; as the Prospectiue glasse is an Instrument, carrying our sight more vnitedly to the obiect; but yet nothing auailes a blind man, to procure sight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as looke into the glasse of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> see all things that are the obiect of diuine vision; as he that lookes into an Opticke glasse, sees all things the end of the glasse buts vpon: but the Saints in glory, see not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:27800:153"/>of Diuine vision, which is things present, past, and future, seing all things are present with God. The <hi>Angels</hi> know not the day of Iudgement, which is part of diuine vision, as well as the state of the Church on earth: Therefore the Saints in glory looke not through the glasse of the <hi>Trinitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The second degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is Immediate vision; here in the way we haue a sight of God, faith beholding things inuisible to Reason, but tis but through the lattesse, or standing behind our wall, onely by the mediation of his word &amp; works, by which God is not desciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redaccording to his essence, but according to our modell of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension; here his Saints see but his backe parts at the most: it being impossible that a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Gods word and workes are, should comprehend that is Infinite, but there we shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:27800:154"/>hold him face to face, in as full and ample manner, as tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a finite capacity (extended to the highest straine) can conceiue an infinite one. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third degree, is Rest and freedome; then shall we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend (for euer celebrate rather) that eternall Sabbath of Rest, whereof our weekly Sabbath is a resemblance: here the safest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state is subiect to alteration, the world being maintained by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitude of contrary things; there Eternitie will not alter one iot of our blessednesse, where that promise shall haue its full accomplishment, <hi>They that die in the Lord, rest from their labours;</hi> from the labour of sinne, from the labours of misery, from that worke of faith, and that labour of loue, which here are of vse, from that patience of hope, and grieuance of godly sorrow, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which here in the way of our pilgrimage we groane, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:27800:154"/>sigh. Those of those graces which shall remaine, haue other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of heauenly imployment. This rest is by the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to beds, which are our sweetest refreshings. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.2. And as our <hi>Conscience</hi> hath rest, so freedome; <hi>Conscience</hi> will then haue finished its apprentiship, and is freed from,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Imperfection; here it is assailed with error, ignorance, scruple, and stupiditie, whereby it mistakes the obiect, calling e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill good, good euill; and also bindes it selfe with lawes the Lord neuer made; yea, here it oft times suspends it verdict, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the heart to take the swing in what it lusteth; but there all these blemishes shall be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and it truely determine of good onely, sith no euill can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade, much lesse inhabit those Mansions of holinesse, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It shall haue freedome from
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:27800:155"/>violence and wounds, by any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered passion, now the sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all appetites will doe what they lust: and if <hi>Conscience</hi> offer to gainesay them, they threaten turning its necke behinde it, and care not a rush for its authoritie: but there all disorder brought in by sin, shall be banished to hell, with its foster-father the <hi>Deuill;</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> shall possesse that former <hi>souer aigntie</hi> it had in the state of <hi>Innocency;</hi> nay, will and affections shall be so heauenly, that they will preuent <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> instigation, striuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to out-strip it in excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It shall haue freedome from its viatory office; here it was Gods <hi>Deputy,</hi> and mans <hi>Iudge,</hi> but after it hath once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vp its account, at the day of Iudgement, it shall neuer be so burdened againe with feares and cares: and indeed it shall not need to record mans life, being free
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:27800:155"/>from blemish, nor yet spurre mans heart to good duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now forward of its owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, hauing put off the shoes of <hi>sensualitie,</hi> and clogges of <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nor yet needs it checke man in the least matter, there being a joynt and sweet harmony in the whole man, to doe the will of the Lord.</p>

<note place="margin">without.</note> Gods Curse vpon man in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> which actually workes in our nature as soone as man by the vnion of soule and body, becomes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, tending not only to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauing
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:27800:161"/>of all the faculties, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and members, but all their actions, which euer they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, during the state of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet is this most iust in God, hee being a common person, and parent; and we in this diuine Relation, as truely parts of him, as any members of his body: No man blames a Iudge in the execution of a wife, or murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse, though shee haue already conceiued Child, if it be before the time of life, for till then it is not a person, nor can be distinct from the mother; so the Lord censures vs before we had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall existence, or any being in Reason, sauing in that <hi>Idea</hi> and <hi>Arch-type</hi> of the creatures, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the diuine minde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Natures defect in the body, which being the soules Organ, and instrument, doth either fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or hinder the soules dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in working, as it is more
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:27800:162"/>or lesse fitly organized, thereto; hence it is, that where the body answeres not the soules agility, and dexterity: the mind of man is possessed with folly, or distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by phrensie, or lunacy: yet these defects in nature, doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing blemish the perfection of Gods workemanship; seeing the perfection of the whole, shines forth the rather in the debilitie of the parts of some of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; as the benefit of sight is best discerned, by the beholding of a blind mans carriage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third cause, is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Iudgements: men abuse the light of knowledge, in withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the offer of Gods grace; which occasions the Lord to giue them ouer to <hi>spiritual blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> that in seeing by (specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) they vnderstand not (prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically,) but grow more hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, and in Iudgment more stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid daily. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6 10. Yet is the Lord herein most Iust. An Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:27800:162"/>hath giuen him by his Maister a Candle, to light him to bed, which he abuses in ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to game, or drinke; whereupon his Maister takes it from him, blowes it out, and sendes him darkling to bed. In the way whereto, he breakes his face, or armes, by some fall. Will any man blaine the Maister, sith the Candle was his, and allowed onely for vse? I trow not; euen so, our abuse of the knowledge we haue, occasions this Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now the causes from within man; are these,
<note place="margin">Within.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Originall sinne.</hi> The staine and filth whereof, is as naturall, and hereditary, as any qualitie in man, making vs for the present lyable to Gods wrath, and by working in our affections, and members, bringeth forth dayly more vngodlinesse, whereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the light of Reason in the <hi>Conscience</hi> is eclipsed. Euery sin
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:27800:163"/>is of an attractiue and growing nature, encreasing from little to more; and like a <hi>Gangrene</hi> in our joynt, secretly creepes vpon the whole: so this naturall impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, til it haue brought our whole nature to sins conformitie: this growth of sinne is set forth by S. <hi>Iames</hi> 1.14.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ignorance; when the mind of man is destitute of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of good and euill, it comes to passe, that much filthinesse lodges in mans bosome, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, vncensured <hi>Nature</hi> sayth, <hi>Euery like begets the like to it selfe,</hi> so naturall blindnes begets such stupiditie, that some men differ little from beasts, vnlesse it be in the worser part. Where doth I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, Atheisme: securitie, and vnteachablenesse raigne, but where Ignorance is had in high esteeme? <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neglect: while men har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their faces against <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> voyce, rushing on what it

Also, Custome of sinning causes habits of impietie, which cleaue as fast as the flesh to the bones; and therefore as they are acquned by frequent action, so neuer abolished but by much sorrow, and instancy in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The raigne of sinne addes much to the defilement of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi> where euer any notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vice beares sway, all the powers of nature are made drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereto, whereby the mind it selfe is heaued off the hinges; and after a while is content to see, and winke, and winke and see. <hi>Iudas</hi> a long while suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the flames of <hi>couetousnesse,</hi> by the greene wood of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent bagge, and future enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by his Maisters earthly Kingdome, which after brake

Lazinesse, and contentment with naturall light, which makes the person vnfit to be wrought vpon; they haue not liued thus long, but they hope they know their duties, as well as the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher can tell them; and for faith, he is not worthy to liue, that will not beleeue God; they thanke God, they haue alwayes had a true faith, and good hearts to God-ward; and so long, let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say their pleasures, they will like themselues, nor their state euer the worse. This is the sicknesse of many <hi>English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> who cōtenting themselues with the name and shell of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, liue and die in a carelesse
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:27800:165"/>and fruitlesse vse of the day, and meanes of grace. Thus <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> occasioned her vtter ruine, by despising her <hi>visitation,</hi> Luk. 19.42.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another degree is wilfull and affected ignorance; when men see the light, but dare not approach it, least they should be reprooued by it, and so their hearts (now quiet) diseased thereby. Like the <hi>Elephant</hi> they are, which before he drinkes, bemuds the water, least his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie should appeare. Some of these I haue known run from their own Pastor, in whose doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine there was a cutting power, to other <hi>Sir Iohn Lack-latines,</hi> vnworthy the name of a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> These men would fame haue a smooth and euen way, without trubbes; but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery hath so galled their hearts, that they could not sleepe qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly in their beds; and hence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue to shut their eares <hi>from
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:27800:166"/>hearing the Law,</hi> as Owles hating the light of the truth. This is a further degree then the former, wherein <hi>Conscience</hi> it selfe rises vp in Armes against God, its Maister. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19.20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third degree, is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary consent to the temptation; when not onely the inferiour powers of the soule; but the mind and <hi>Conscience</hi> grow dissolute, which indeed should struggle, and reluct against sinne, yet now is become an Agent, and Factor for it: and is therefore fitted with colours, and distinctions, to set a faire die on a foule cause, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>terrors of the Lord,</hi> into a doctrine of libertie in sinne, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa.</hi> 22.13. <hi>Let vs eate and drinke,</hi> (say these Ruffians) <hi>for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row we must die.</hi> A strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Impenitency, when men can acknowledge a Iudgement, and to morrow next, the day of appearance before the Lords tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall; and yet these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:27800:166"/>worke no remorse in their hearts, but rather a hellish Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to swill and sweare, while they haue an houre to breath; whose censure in the 14. verse, is most terrible, to wit, <hi>finall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The last and worst degree of this vncleanenesse, is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie to sinne, and Satans I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; sinne is now so incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in them, that while they liue and moue, they cannot but doe it. This Image of hell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A direct hatred of all truth, and honestie, taking the grossest crimes for vertues, if they tend any way to the disparagement of the truth. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.2. Our Lord mentions some, whose <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> were so hellish, they deemed it <hi>good seruice to God, to kill his Disciples.</hi> And haue not our eyes seene them, who haue wished one moneths libertie, for the butchery of the Saints?</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:27800:167"/>
               <p n="2">2. A loue and liking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is directly euill; how many are there, whose <hi>sleepe departes from them, vnlesse they cause some to fall?</hi> The deuils purueyers for the foulest Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whose wils are turned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from God. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the euill, and vnquiet in the <hi>Conscience,</hi> after this life; it must be obserued by way of premonition, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer euill offices, mans <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> doth him here, the same it continues to the damned, after the period of mortalitie; sith it is then specially one of the <hi>Lords Executioners,</hi> to inflict that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gods wrath, being one of <hi>his vials, filled full of the wine of Gods indignation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Illustration whereof, obserue with me;
<list>
                     <item>1. The actions it doth.</item>
                     <item>2. The manner.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The actions;</p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:27800:167"/>
               <p n="1">1. It vpbraides; 1. with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: 2. losse.</p>
               <p>With neglect;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of many sound and just Reproofes, pressed on their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> by the Word, diuiding them their present portiō, which they posted off without attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without reformation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of so many sweet Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inuiting to the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent state of holinesse, of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, to which yet it turned the deafe eare, esteeming Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a disgrace to a manly, and generous spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of so many gentle correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and warnings from the Lord, to haue weaned them from the sweet of sinne, by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the thorny hedge of troubles, which yet they haue slighted, hating to returne, <hi>Iere.</hi> 2.30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It vpbraides the heart, with the losse of,</p>
               <p n="1">1. So many gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:27800:168"/>which they might haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed as well as any others, had they not hardened the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the condition of holines, required therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of such holy motions, as were distilled into their hearts by the spirit of grace, which yet they haue quenched by wilfull resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; alas, many a sigh, and godly wish, they haue strangled in the birth, which now they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of Redemption by Christ, the efficacy of whose bloud, was offered to them in the Gospell, which yet they haue trampled vnder-foot, as an vnhallowed thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, it vpbraides the losse of the possibilitie of heauenly glory; a Sermon of blessednesse in their liues, was lesse esteemed then a winter-tale, but now they prize the <hi>inheritance of the Saints,</hi> whom formerly (poore Snakes) they did lade with disgraces;
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:27800:168"/>but now if they had a thousand worlds, they would depart with all, for the fruition of their joyes one houre. Now the cleare visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, the societie of the Saints, and Riuers of pleasures at the right hand of God, runne in their minds: O that they could forget their losse!</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second action it doth, is, It wounds, and gnawes, &amp; lashes the heart of man, fretting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man, for the former euils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Now the <hi>Consciences</hi> of many men, are lulled asleepe, on the downe-beds of securitie; but then its clamors will be so loud, its voyce so shrill, and peircing, that it is a very hell, to endure an enraged <hi>Conscience,</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings whereof, we may see in persons male-content, who fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sting of an accusing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> seeke by laying violent nands on their owne liues, to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape its galling. This, some haue compared to a Vulture, euer
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:27800:169"/>gnawing, and feeding on mans heart, to a fury, euery haire of whose head was a venemous Snake; so wittie men haue beene to set forth their owne misery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It terrifies and affrights the damned: a guiltie <hi>Conscience</hi> (we know) makes men deeme euery tale that is told, is of them, and to thinke, that euery bush is a beare; causing <hi>feare where no feare is.</hi> Much more will it skare the sinner, in the pit of perdition; where euen the soules haue their obiects of feare, and terror. If <hi>Cain</hi> on earth feared, euery man would kill him, vexed with guilt of <hi>conscience,</hi> what a peck of feares thinke we him in now, enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>a Legion of Deuils?</hi> who besides the Lords Commission, haue euer ought man a bitter spight. Hence arise those wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, and wailings, those skrek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and howlings, mentioned <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, It subscribes the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:27800:169"/>righteous judgment of the <hi>Lord,</hi> confessing its desert, to be no lesse then the punishment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; <hi>Mans spirit will sustaine his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie.</hi> While <hi>Conscience</hi> takes our part, it is no smal matter can appall mans heart, but here it is become mans enemy, setting in foot with the <hi>Tormentor;</hi> prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king those hellish furies to lay on loade, and spare not, sith he hath out-faced the <hi>Iudge</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in despising the offer of his grace: and also replying to mans hellish out-cryes; nay, it is well done, I told thee as much when thou mightest haue preuented it; nay, beshrew him if he spare thee: now thou feelest what it is to sinne against God; what to offend a <hi>Conscience</hi> so friendly, so sweet a companion.</p>
               <p>These are the actions it doth; the manner followes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All these euill offices it doth most rigorously: during this life, it was so weake, and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:27800:170"/>maimed, that its offices were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left vndone, or without life, and power; so that the sinner neither felt, nor feared its lashes; but now like a robbed Beare, or trodden-Serpent, it prosecutes him with the haue &amp; cry of <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> mercilesse and endlesse <hi>torment.</hi> There no colourable distinction will stop its mouth, no bribes of pleasure, or profit, can cause its silence. From this rigor of <hi>Conscience,</hi> wee haue a Prouerbe; <hi>He hath a hell in his bosome as goodly as he makes it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 All these it doth restlesly, giuing the sinner no ease, no res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit: In this life paines and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases haue their fits, twixt which there is a breathing space, to reuiue the spirits: but in hell, <hi>Conscience</hi> neuer blines condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, lashing, and torturing the sinner, being set on, and backed by an infinite, and endlesse wrath, the edge of its reproofes, will no longer be dulled; it sets
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:27800:170"/>it on for forgetting; and for this cause, its fitly resembled to that disease, called the <hi>Wolfe,</hi> which is euer sucking and gnawing, till it haue made man like an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, neuer ceasing till it haue exhausted the vitall powers. In that torment the Glutton shalbe denied one drop of water, one dram of refreshing to his paine: <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25.</p>
               <p n="3">3 All these it doth Eternally, after Millions of Millions are spent in tbose fiery flames, their yeares are as ready to begin as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: a Childe with a spoone may sooner empty the sea, then they accomplish their misery, this word <hi>neuer,</hi> is that which galles the heart of a sinner: on earth we say, <hi>extreame passions take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way sense,</hi> and <hi>nothing violent is perpetuall:</hi> but in hell it is farre otherwise, a wonderment it is, how the powers of nature shall be fitted for torment, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one would thinke such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:27800:171"/>of paine, would breake the stoutest heart, yet the same <hi>wrath</hi> that imposes positiue torment, supplies spirits to beare it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consumption, without anul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>a riuer of brimstone is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by burning:</hi> Reue. 14.11. Isay 66. vlt.</p>
               <p>But me thinkes I heare you obiecting,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>
                  </label> how doe you know these things of hellish <hi>Conscience,</hi> hauing neuer felt them?</p>

                  </label> can not a man know that fire is hote, vnlesse hee put his finger into the flame? All these offices <hi>conscience</hi> performes to sicke persons, and men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die, being but the first fruits of their future inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but tell me, wast thou euer in the <hi>Purgatory</hi> of an afflicted <hi>Conscience?</hi> Didst thou euer feele the <hi>terrors of the Lord?</hi> or hast beene skared <hi>by dreames and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the night?</hi> Or hast thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer learned, what a thing it is to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:27800:171"/>behold a guiltie <hi>Conscience?</hi> and an angry <hi>God</hi> without <hi>Christ?</hi> If not, blesse God for the sense of his loue; or otherwise, thou wouldest haue felt as much, as now thou hearest.</p>
               <p>These degrees of euill in the <hi>Conscience,</hi> are of vse for Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Exhortation.</p>

<note place="margin">Infor.</note> in imposing the same torment on wicked men, he doth on euill Angels, they are as like as two twins can be: Satan was his own <hi>tempter,</hi> so they wilfully harden their owne hearts; he hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

As persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Plague, are thrust into the Pest-house together, though of different qualitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;

               <p n="2">2.
<note place="margin">Infor.</note> It informes vs how great &amp; exquisite the torments of hell are; for if one facultie hath so much fury, as to make man thus miserable, what may we thinke will be the torment of the whole? if the scalding of one finger will cause so much smart, what will not the torture of all the senses, and members? Besides, if that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the Schoolemen be warrantable, of the paine of <hi>sense,</hi> and paine of <hi>losse;</hi> and that (as they say) the losse of Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and the priuation of the loyes of heauen, doth more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict them, then all the sensible torment. Sure, words may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what intimate, and comparisons resemble; but no Art of man can punctually describe that vneffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble measure of <hi>torment, prepared for the Deuill, and his Angels.</hi> Mat. 25.40.</p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:27800:172"/>
               <p n="3">3. This also Informes vs,
<note place="margin">Infor.</note> there will come a day, when wicked men will approue Religion, and wish a thousand times, that they had but one houres respite, that once more they might heare the voyce of the meanest of those Ministers, they formerly haue despised; counting them happie that haue <hi>the bels of Aaron</hi> soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their Assemblies, who haue time, and opportunitie, to preuent their condemnation.

               <p>These degrees of vncleannesse,

               <p>The third thing proposed,
<note place="margin">Kindes.</note> concerning this acquired vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, is the kindes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Conscience</hi> seemingly good, which hath such faire demeanor towards men, that its often taken for <hi>renued Conscience;</hi> such is the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:27800:174"/>
                  <hi>Conscience</hi> of Ciuill honest men, who are very strict in obseruance of common Iustice; that one would judge, it were for loue of vertue, and <hi>conscience</hi> of GOD; whereas indeed vertue, in case it outstrip their modell, and selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing course, is abhominable in their eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In hypocrites, who will run themselues out of breath in outward performances, and giue Religion such gilded words, and goodly shewes, as passes; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none of the <hi>Lords plants,</hi> are sure to be rooted out. Both these in the eyes of the world, are the onely Christians; whose <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> were as yet neuer purged from their vncleannesse.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Erronious Conscience,</hi> that smites for well-doing, or omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of euill; being either in</p>
               <p n="1">1. Superstitious persons, who more trouble themselues about <hi>Annise</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> then <hi>the weightier points of the Law, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:27800:174"/>and iudgement.</hi> Catch at the shaddow, and so lose the substance of Religion. Thus our <hi>Popish Recusants</hi> make <hi>conscience</hi> of flesh-meates, and numerall prayers, neglecting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Sabbaths of the Lord. And for subiection to authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they count it meritorious, to murther the <hi>Lords Annointed.</hi>
               </p>

Thus our <hi>Seperatistes</hi> will haue a Church free from Imperfections; and many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted Christians, depriue themselues of much peace, and

               <p>The fourth thing proposed,
<note place="margin">Properties.</note> is the properties of this <hi>euill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi> which are these,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is quiet, suffering man to slugge in sinne without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse; as in those persons, <hi>Iere.</hi> 7.10. who presumed of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, though <hi>they did lie, and steale, &amp; murther,</hi> and other such like abhominations.</p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Renued good Conscience</hi> is quiet, as well as this <hi>euill and benummed,</hi> yet they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in maine and essential things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the causes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Motiues.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Durance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the causes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Euill</hi> is quiet out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, not discerning what is right, what wrong; and though
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:27800:177"/>there be motes, yet the beames of diuine light are wanting, to discerne them, <hi>Ion.</hi> 4.11. But <hi>good,</hi> is quiet out of Innocency; it hath made priuie search in the heart, and can finde nothing to quarrel about, the <hi>couenant of the Lord</hi> being obserued sincerely, according to desire, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Euill</hi> is quiet out of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, as being vnable to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet mans heart; such is the weakenesse of the one, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the other; but the <hi>good</hi> is quiet out of veritie, it vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination hath found the heart adorned with many excellent graces, and the life beautified with good workes: so that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it should lye against its own knowledge, it cannot doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They differ in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Euill</hi> is quiet, and of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of rest, it would by any
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:27800:177"/>meanes be at peace with it selfe, though it buy it deare; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dares not come to the light, willing rather to feele hell euer, then heare of it once. <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its quiet, out of a loathnesse to account, it cannot endure to heare of the Reckoning. Its run it knows not how far into arrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages with God; it dares not cast vp its debt-booke, Iudgement is so tedious to heare of, it chooses rather to put heauen to a perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, then disquiet the heart by examination.</p>
               <p>Contrarily, <hi>good Conscience</hi> hath other motiues, such plaine demonstrations from the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the life, such experience of the humilitie, and sinceritie of the heart, with whom it hath had daily, and familiar conuerse, that it should much abuse its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in vexing such <hi>a true Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite,</hi> and plaine hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The witnesse of the spirit
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:27800:178"/>of God, vttering a sweete voyce, and working in vs a strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that we are in the state of grace; and from this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there issues a sweete calme in mans <hi>Conscience.</hi> Peace of heart being one of the fruits of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third difference, is in the durance of this quiet;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Euill</hi> is quiet onely till it awake from the sleepe of <hi>securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> If at any time the Word come home to the <hi>Conscience, Ahabes conscience</hi> bestirres it; or if Gods immediate hand of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction doe but rowse it, then as a band dog, it flyes into its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters face.</p>
               <p n="2">2. At the farthest, it is quiet but till the particular appearance in <hi>Iudgement.</hi> Suppose it be <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> and so without life, yet that is respecting vs onely, all its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices respecting God, remaine entire, so that at the day of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons it will produce volumes
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:27800:178"/>of a large size, <hi>to arraigne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the sinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the contrary, <hi>good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is quiet;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Vntill the person step aside by some disorder, and then as a sweet <hi>friend,</hi> it takes him by the hand, and tels him roundly of his miscarriage. 3 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its quiet with vs onely while our <hi>couenant</hi> with God is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or being violated, vntill we haue sued our our <hi>quietus est,</hi> out of the Lords Court of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations, stand out with God in neglect of godly sorrow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, or other holy duties, and <hi>conscience</hi> will be at daggers with thee. <hi>Euils of smart</hi> it matters not a rush, but those <hi>of sin,</hi> it can no way digest. <hi>Dauid findes no rest in his bones,</hi> till he gat to confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second propertie of <hi>an euill Conscience,</hi> is stirring, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such distemper in the heart of man, that a dog would not
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:27800:179"/>endure such a life, like a band dog, barking night and day, so that <hi>in the middest of his iollitie, the heart is sorrowfull;</hi> yet for that you may remember, it was a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Renued good Conscience,</hi> it will be worth our labour to difference them: differ they doe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the grounds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Manner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Issue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the grounds; <hi>Euill</hi> stirres in man, for that he is out of the <hi>couenant,</hi> an enemy to <hi>God,</hi> and an heire of wrath. <hi>Caines</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet was, that God was bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, his state damnable, and his sinne irremissible. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13.14. But <hi>good Conscience</hi> stirres, for that it hath failed in keeping the <hi>couenant;</hi> for that so holy a Law hath beene violated, and so kind a father offended, as for the state of grace, it neuer questions that, vnlesse it be in some spirituall swoone, which lasts not long, but the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returnes.</p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:27800:179"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Euill</hi> stirres at sinne, not as sinne, not as a violation of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine law, but as a meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure misery. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Simons</hi> care was, <hi>that none of those things might befall him;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.30.</note> and <hi>Saul</hi> desires to be graced before the people, for God it was no matter. But <hi>good</hi> stirres more at sinne, then an hundred plagues. When <hi>Dauids Conscience</hi> stird, his complaint was, <hi>take away the sinne of thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant;</hi> as for the punishment, he not only kisses the rod in choice of a plague, but would haue none smart for it but himselfe; <hi>Alas, what haue these sheepe done; I and my fathers house haue sinned.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Euill Conscience</hi> stirres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly, by fits and starts, now and then, when it cannot chuse, after it hath surfeited of lazinesse many a faire day; the heart being leauened with impietie, soone smoothers any good motions
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:27800:180"/>distilled thereinto. Thus it fared with <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.23. But <hi>good,</hi> being euer wakefull: a <hi>good Centinell</hi> stirres at euery disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, no sooner can a wicked lust peere out the head, but its cald to <hi>Conscience Court,</hi> and there censured.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Euill</hi> stirres alwayes in the extreames, either so coldly, that it makes not the sinner blush, or else being suddenly awaked, it rages so furiously, that there is no liuing by it; making the wounded heart, to runne vp and downe, like a stricken Deare, with the deadly arrow hanging in his side. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.15. But <hi>good</hi> shunnes both those extreames, it gently, and mildly, yet imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and effectually admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes the disordered heart; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needs much adoe, the heart being tractable to good, attends its voyce, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ in the issue of this contention;</p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:27800:180"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Euill</hi> stirring, driues the sinner from God; the sound of its voyce being onely <hi>damnation,</hi> and the <hi>torments of hell,</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending God as a terrible God, its impossible, that the soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding God out of Christ, should euer swimme out of the gulfe of <hi>despaire.</hi> Thus <hi>Saul</hi> runs to a <hi>Witch</hi> at <hi>Endor,</hi> 2 Sam. 28.8. But <hi>good Conscience</hi> so stirres, as that it driues the sinner from himselfe, but euer to God; it dares not deny the <hi>Word of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that speakes to vs as to sons;</hi> its quarrell being against sinne, and not the person; it leads him to the fountaine of mercy, by contrition of heart. <hi>Peter</hi> goes out and weepes bitterly for his offence. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.62.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Euill</hi> so stirres, that it armes the sinner against himselfe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; if <hi>Saul be vexed with the euill spirit,</hi> he will not spare his <hi>Ionathan,</hi> if he speake but a crosse word. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.33. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:27800:181"/>male-content, haue beene the executioners of wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And <hi>Iudas,</hi> stung with guilt of <hi>Conscience,</hi> in a desperate moode, <hi>throwes himselfe downe headlong, and so burst asunder, Act.</hi> 1.18. But <hi>good Conscience</hi> so stirres, as that it remooues sinne, which is as an euill disease in our bones; and by assurance, doth so reuiue the drooping spirits, that all the powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fare the better; its <hi>health to the nauill, marrow to the bones.</hi> Pro. 17.22.</p>
               <p>The third Propertie of this <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Conscience</hi> is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Its mutable, off and on; sometimes it will carry a face of sinceritie; by and by as dissolute, as shame of men, and feare of lawes, will suffer it. In case it falls into good company, its carriage shall be so demure, and semblable, its speeches in pure print; that one would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire its facilitie herein; yet when it comes into the worlds sinfull
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:27800:181"/>mates, it will swill, and sweare, and reuile amongst the thickest. True it is, <hi>naturall Conscience</hi> can both discerne, and dislike some grosser crimes, vntill it be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set in temptation, and then, when suggestion will haue no nay, it is shamefully foyled. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> a while stickes to Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, out of <hi>Conscience</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie; yet their instancy (good Rulers must yeeld something to euill manners, for feare of muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) was a great stumbling block, especially, the feare least a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint should be carried to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar, Ioh.</hi> 19.12. and his office endangered. A perillous matter, when (silly man) thy office and natiue soyle, are forfeited here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and thou driuen to dispend the remainder of thy bitter houres in exile.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Euill Conscience</hi> is partiall; there is some fat sinne or other, it is pleased to spare, the sweete whereof, it puttes vnder the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:27800:182"/>tongue. Some will reforme their sinnes of <hi>pleasure,</hi> others of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;</hi> some their great sinnes, which the world cryes shame of; others their lesser crimes, being not strongly tempted thereto. But where is he that will throughly <hi>purge his Conscience from dead workes?</hi> Vntill <hi>Iohn</hi> come to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> bosome-sinne, he shall be wel-come to the <hi>Court,</hi> and haue all possible grace from the King; but if he touch his <hi>white sinne,</hi> (and who will stand still to haue his eyes put out) <hi>Iohn</hi> must to prison. Such a fondling is his darling lust, that the <hi>Word</hi> must not blow vpon it; when yet if <hi>Iohn</hi> will hoouer aloofe, and conteine himselfe in <hi>forraine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> he is the onely Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; and to gratifie his paines, <hi>many things shall be reformed. Mark.</hi> 16.20.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Euill Conscience,</hi> is lazie and blockish, nothing will sinke into it; it hath beene weeted with
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:27800:182"/>the sweete influence of heauen: all the good creatures of God, haue beene seruants to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; yea, it hath had the good word of God, with the offer of saluation, proposed to its choice. Besides, God <hi>as a iust Iudge,</hi> hath followed it with his scourge, to see if by any meanes, he could make sinne abhominable; and yet its neuer the better, nothing will worke vpon it. Is it not a wonder, that many Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, after so much sweate, and paines of their <hi>Pastor,</hi> are yet so ignorant, and stupid, in matter of godlinesse? Sure, they are possessed with the <hi>dumbe</hi> and <hi>deafe spirit</hi> of obstinacy, &amp; their hearts <hi>shut vp in vnbeliefe,</hi> or else something, at least, Conformitie to outward Religion, would be wrought in them. <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Euill Conscience</hi> is declining, growing daily worse and worse; that light it hath by nature, or education, is extinct by neglect.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:27800:183"/>Custome in sin hath raised such a mist, or damp in the <hi>conscience,</hi> that the very light in mans mind is become darknesse, and sinne goes vnseene, vncontrolled, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the full measure of Impietie be fulfilled; <hi>No man suddenly growes most wicked:</hi> This <hi>Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice</hi> is not hatched in an instant. <hi>Conscience</hi> in the vilest varlet, at the first hath some sparkes of honesty in it, which being drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in deepe securitie, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with a whole Rout of vnruly lusts, man in time comes to that degree of impietie, that he sinneth sinningly, earnestly, and with both hands, hauing forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be wise and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13.</p>

                  </label> by whose vertue it is onely, that the <hi>Conscience</hi> is purged from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. The poyson of sinne, is of such a mortall, and deadly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that nothing in heauen or earth, is so medicinall as to cure it, sauing the blood of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lambe of God.</hi> Thou mayest <hi>make a couenant with hell, and death,</hi> and <hi>daube</hi> vp the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of thy soule <hi>with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered morter</hi> of selfe-flattery; yet <hi>Conscience</hi> is so far from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that the wounds are farre deeper; securitie being added to impietie. Also thou mayest with <hi>Saul,</hi> get some <hi>skilfull Musitian</hi> to driue away thy dumpes; or with <hi>Cain</hi> build Cities; thinking by multiplicitie of affaires, to stop its clamors, or (which is

               <p n="2">2. Seeke after <hi>Knowledge as after hid treasure;</hi> acquaintance with Gods word, resolues doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cases, about which oft times tender <hi>consciences</hi> are disquieted. Knowledge discouers a world of disorder, which otherwise lies hid in the heart of man.

               <p n="3">3. Earnestly; contend for the <hi>faith of Gods elect,</hi> which is a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Medicine to an impure heart.

By bringing to vs the <hi>fine linnen of Christs righteousnesse, to couer our deformities,</hi> both of nature, and practice. 2. By pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the feare of God in mans heart, whereby euill motions are chased away, and holy desires nourished in vs; for who is it that can see such loue in Christ, as is manifested in the worke of our Redemption, but also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes both vnworthinesse in himselfe of such mercies, as also a chaine of duties, which this
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:27800:186"/>load-stone of loue drawes after it, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.4. Faith also is of an attractiue nature, and mixing it selfe with the promise, suckes out of the liuing Word, such strong assurance of Gods face reconciled, that nothing in this earth can destroy the sweet peace it hath, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.3.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>Lastly, the <hi>first Commandement</hi> is not a little defaced by their doctrine, as <hi>Ignorance is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Deuotion;</hi> away then with knowledge, as idle speculation.

These two sometimes concurre, as in <hi>Num.</hi> 25.2. <hi>Balaam</hi> scandalized <hi>Israel actiuely,</hi> by suborning women to be sent amongst them; and <hi>Israel</hi> was <hi>passiuely</hi> scandalized, in that by yeelding vnto the temptation, they fell into <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> and <hi>spirituall</hi> Adultery.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>Actiue</hi> scandall goes alone, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.16.17. where the <hi>Herodians</hi> did tempt Christ about the matter of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Place;</hi> when things good are abused by celebration, in a place not beseeming the same. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2. The <hi>Pharisies</hi> praying priuate prayer in <hi>publicke place,</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Person;</hi> when any arrogate to themselues what appertaines to others offices, medling with <hi>holy things,</hi> without commission from God. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.13. being in a strait, will needs thrust himselfe into the <hi>Priestes office,</hi> but was therefore thrust out of <hi>his owne office</hi> by GOD.

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>person;</hi> He must be a member of the same Church,
